subtitle: I'm a senior software engineer. What else?
---

I'm Michele **skypjack** Caini, a software developer from Florence, Italy. When I need something, I develop it (and publish my projects for the open source community if possible).  
I'm also the author of:

* [`EnTT`](https://github.com/skypjack/entt), an open source library written in C++ and [used also by Mojang](https://minecraft.net/en-us/attribution/) in **Minecraft**.
* [`uvw`](https://github.com/skypjack/uvw), probably the most used C++ wrapper for **libuv**.

And some other projects quite used but certainly less known than the two above.  
Take a look at my [GitHub account](https://github.com/skypjack) to see what I'm working on.

I'm usually active all around the web, from [GitHub](https://github.com/skypjack) to [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/4987285/skypjack) and all in between.  
In my free time I dedicate myself mainly to my wife and my son. And when I take a minute for myself, I like to spend my time developing **small 2D games** (the only ones I can complete alone in the short time available) or working on `EnTT`, `uvw` and the others.

### Support

Unfortunately it's difficult to start new open source projects, maintain a high level of quality (the same required to become part of the second best-selling game ever), add new features and give support on different tools, not being able to work on them except in the free time.

This is why **your support is important and can make the difference**.

If you like my works and you're using them in your real world products or if you just want to help me, consider to [**donate**](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_donations&business=W2HF9FESD5LJY&lc=IT&item_name=Michele%20Caini&currency_code=EUR&bn=PP%2dDonationsBF%3abtn_donateCC_LG%2egif%3aNonHosted) or to [**become a patron**](https://www.patreon.com/bePatron?c=1772573) and allow me to spend more and more time on the projects you love.

**Thank you**.
