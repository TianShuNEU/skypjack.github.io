# skypjack on software

[This is my personal blog](https://skypjack.github.io/). I hope you'll find it
interesting.

These are some of my thoughts, in no way related to any company or to my daily
job.<br/>
Everything you can read from this blog is the result of what I do mainly in the
open source. It's nothing but a way to share with everyone what I have learned
so far and still learn every day along my journey.

## What's that about?

Software design, the internals of the libraries I wrote or to which I
contribute, various topics related to software that I develop privately but
which also have an impact in open source, and so on.<br/>
And also: slides presented at conferences to which I'm invited or to which I
participate spontaneously, in-depth analysis of topics touched in some chats I'm
in by chance, random ideas and much more.

This blog isn't about a single topic, it's all about technology and C++ instead.

## Let me know that it helped

It's the only way you have to let me know that you appreciate my work.
