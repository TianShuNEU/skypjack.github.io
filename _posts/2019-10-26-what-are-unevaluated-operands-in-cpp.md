title: What are unevaluated operands in C++?
subtitle: Hello choice trick
tags: [article, cpp]
---

Recently I had the opportunity to write an
[article](https://humanreadablemag.com/issues/0/articles/what-are-unevaluated-operands-in-c/)
for a new online magazine, [Human Readable](https://humanreadablemag.com/).<br/>
Generally, these kinds of things don't go public and are only accessible with a
subscription. However, [the first issue](https://humanreadablemag.com/issues/0/)
was published for everyone and my article is therefore freely available!

The topic is my beloved C++. What else?<br/>
The article is about _unevaluated operands_ (if you don't know what they are,
it's one more reason to read it) and the _choice trick_, a method almost unknown
but very clever to solve a quite common problem.

Don't miss the chance to read my
[article](https://humanreadablemag.com/issues/0/articles/what-are-unevaluated-operands-in-c/)
online!
