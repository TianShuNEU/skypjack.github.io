[These]({{ site.baseurl }}/pdf/the_cpp_of_entt.pdf) are the slides of a talk I
gave at the
[Level UP Conference 2019](http://levelup.aiv01.it/IT/News/3/Level_Up_2019/434)
in Rome. The conference was organized by [AIV](https://www.aiv01.it/en/), the
Italian Academy of Videogames.<br/>
I was asked to talk about the C++ of [EnTT](https://github.com/skypjack/entt)
and the techniques mainly used in the library. Unfortunately the time wasn't
that much to explore all of them. Therefore, I decided to talk about two idioms
widely adopted by the C++ community: **type erasure** and **SFINAE**.

The talk wasn't recorded as far as I know. Therefore, it isn't possible to add a
link to a video in which these slides are commented and completed as they
deserve.
